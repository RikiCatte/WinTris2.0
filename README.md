# WinTris2.0
v2.0 contains some improvements compared to the older version of the game (1.0), for example you can now choose to play with the PC or with another player (human)

If you find error/s in the code, please let me know of that, contacting me on Discord (RikiCatte#1371). NOTE: you can find the compiled .exe in WinTris2.0/x64/Release or in my website (https://www.rikicatte.it)
